# Data Scraping Project

This project involves data scraping using Python to gather information automatically from websites.

## Features

- **Automated Data Scraping**: This script uses libraries such as `BeautifulSoup` or `Selenium` (customize this based on the libraries used) to extract data from websites.
- **Output Formats**: The extracted data can be exported to various formats, such as CSV or JSON.
